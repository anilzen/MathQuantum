MathQuantum undegrad, grad, and postdoctoral fellowships are a core element of our Research Training Group. Two main groups are ideal candidates for our fellowships: (a) current Math students with no or little experience in quantum, who want to enter QIS and (b) current students with moderate or high experience in QIS who want to advance their QIS work with stronger Math skills. The goal is to enable crossover between Math and QIS, so our program aims to fill any skills and knowledge gaps.
All fellows participate in:
- Mentored [research](/research) and [interdisciplinary training](/training) in applying mathematics to quantum information science problems
- Coursework and seminars in theoretical and applied mathematics for quantum information science
- Internship opportunities at quantum companies and government labs
- Professional development and networking opportunities (including Broader Impacts and proposal writing)
- One-on-one career mentoring and guidance
- Community-building and outreach activities
Learn below about each type of fellowship.
