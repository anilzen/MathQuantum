Come learn some basics of financial literacy, focused on the context of undergraduate and graduate students.

In this seminar, we will cover financial concepts such as budgeting, spending, and savings. When relevant, we will discuss how being in an academic setting as a student impacts these aspects.

Participants will also have an opportunity to reflect about their own history with and attitudes toward financial strategy.

Individuals of all levels of financial literacy are welcome. Those with experience and insight to share are appreciated attendees!
