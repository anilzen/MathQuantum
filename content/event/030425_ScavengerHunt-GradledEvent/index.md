Students interested in Math and Quantum Information Science will have a chance to network with each other and a select group of faculty who do research in these areas.

The faculty will give a short intro, and then students will receive anonymized abstracts of papers by these faculty.
Their goal will be to guess the identity of each abstract by chatting with the faculty and each other.

Abstracts featured are [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7SHH690CjXT9Kdb-V__KtwX3rSpXPaD/view?usp=share_link).

Food? Of course. Chicken nuggets, wraps, pizza, and snacks will be provided.

This event was part of the MathQuantum Grad-led Event component, where a team of graduate students works together to ideate and run an event of their choice.
