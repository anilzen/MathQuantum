Join us for a movie, snacks and discussion, while meeting others at UMD interested in quantum computing!
Both quantum enthusiasts and quantum experts will enjoy exploring how quantum is presented in popular media.

_Decoding the Universe: Quantum_ (54min) is a 2024 PBS NOVA documentary about quantum concepts.
At this movie night, we will watch the film, and follow it by optional small- and large-group critical discussion.

We will delve into topics such as
- How is quantum represented in popular media (paying attention to accuracy and hype)?
- How does a documentary like this help quantum experts communicate about quantum?
- How does it help quantum enthusiasts understand quantum better?

This event is co-organized by the MathQuantum and [UQA](https://www.umduqa.com).
