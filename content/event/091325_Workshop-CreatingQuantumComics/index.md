In this workshop, participants will create their own short comic about a topic in quantum science.
Exploring this visual medium can open up ways to communicate complex concepts to various audiences, within and outside of science.
No drawing skills required!

The workshop will extend into a lunch, but registration is required to be counted for food.
Register [here](https://q3initiative.org/registration) (UMD QREATE Explorer).

This workshop is in collaboration with the Q3 initiative, so it's part of a 2-day event with other activities (including workshops on 3D modeling and animation) and a challenge with cash prize. See full details [here](https://q3initiative.org).
