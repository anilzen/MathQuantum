title: RIT (Research Interaction Team) in Quantum Information Science
---
## Organizers:
Dong An, Maria Cameron, Carl Miller, Konstantina Trivisa

In this seminar, we are interested in all aspects of research at the intersection between quantum information science and mathematics.  Goals for the seminar include:
Studying recent research results in quantum information from a mathematical angle;
Finding examples (old and new) in which existing tools from mathematics have been adapted for application in quantum information;
Studying quantum algorithms for mathematical problems.
In the Fall 2023 semester, we will focus on tutorial talks that will introduce a basic theoretical toolbox for quantum computing.

Optional: 1 credit. Course number: AMSC689, Section TBA. See Jessica Sadler for help with registration (jsadler@umd.edu). To earn 1 credit, you need to give a talk.

## Session 1 (10/02, 1pm, Kirwan Hall 3206): A Mathematical Perspective on Quantum Information Science
Mathematical innovation has been crucial in quantum information science since its inception, and the relationship between the two fields is vital and evolving.  While the theory of quantum information depends most directly on linear algebra and probability, other mathematical connections appear in quantum research that are diverse and often surprising.  This talk will offer a personal perspective on the interaction between quantum and math.  We will discuss an example from the field of quantum cryptography.  The talk serves as a kickoff to a series of seminars under UMD's new MathQuantum RTG program (https://mathquantum.umd.edu).
