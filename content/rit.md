### Overview:
In this seminar, we are interested in all aspects of research at the intersection between quantum information science and mathematics.
Goals for the seminar include:
- Studying recent research results in quantum information from a mathematical angle;
- Finding examples (old and new) in which existing tools from mathematics have been adapted for application in quantum information;
- Studying quantum algorithms for mathematical problems
- Enabling interaction between researchers interested in collaborating at the intersection between quantum information and mathematics.

If interested in joining, reach out to Daniel Serrano (dsvolpe@umd.edu).
