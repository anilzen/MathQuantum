title: RIT (Research Interaction Team) in Quantum Information Science, Spring 2024
---
### Organizers:
Yusuf Alnawakhtha, Maria Cameron, Carl Miller, Daniel Serrano, Konstantina Trivisa

### When and Where:
Mondays, 4pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)

### Overview:
In this seminar, we are interested in all aspects of research at the intersection between quantum information science and mathematics.  Goals for the seminar include:
- Studying recent research results in quantum information from a mathematical angle;
- Finding examples (old and new) in which existing tools from mathematics have been adapted for application in quantum information;
- Studying quantum algorithms for mathematical problems.

In the Spring 2024 semester, we will focus on hybrid talks where speakers will (i) provide an overview of their research or a QIS topic, followed by (ii) working out a mathematical concept related to the QIS topic on the board, along with the other participants. Sessions where no speakers are slotted will be used for discussion between participants about various topics, including: providing peer feedback, ethics of QIS, how to deliver effective oral presentations.

If interested in joining, reach out to Daniel Serrano (dsvolpe@umd.edu).
Optional: 1 credit. Course number: AMSC689, Section 5201. Reach out to Jessica Sadler for help with registration (jsadler@umd.edu). To earn 1 credit, you need to give a talk and attend all sessions (2 excused absences allowed).

### Session 4 (02/26, 4pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)):
__"Quantum Engineering 101: A Mathematical Perspective" - David Roberts__

The theory of noise, measurement, and amplification in quantum information processing devices deviates substantially from its counterparts in conventional engineering disciplines. Quantum-mechanical systems exhibit distinctly different behavior compared to their classical counterparts, necessitating a revised theoretical framework. In this talk, I will provide a mathematical viewpoint on the theory of quantum noise. As an illustrative example, I will study a quantum-information-theorist's version of a classical Markov chain and demonstrate how the theory deviates from classical expectations.

### Session 3 (02/19, 4pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)):
__"On the construction of an efficient quantum algorithm: A Toolbox" - Konstantina Trivisa__

This session will discuss the construction of a quantum algorithm.

### Session 2 (02/12, 4pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)):
__"The Quantum-Classical Boundary: Decoherence" - Alicia Koll√°r__

This session will go over basics of quantum science, which will be helpful for understanding talks on the mathematics of quantum information science the rest of this semester.

### Session 1 (02/05, 4pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)):
__"Intro and Planning"__

In this session, we will provide an overview of the Spring 2024 format, obtain feedback from participants about topics of interest, and start choosing speaking slots for the rest of the semester.
