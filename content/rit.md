title: RIT (Research Interaction Team) in Quantum Information Science, Spring 2025
---
### Organizers:
Carl Miller, Daniel Serrano, Konstantina Trivisa

### When and Where:
Wednesdays, 1pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)

### Overview:
In this seminar, we are interested in all aspects of research at the intersection between quantum information science and mathematics.
Goals for the seminar include:
- Studying recent research results in quantum information from a mathematical angle;
- Finding examples (old and new) in which existing tools from mathematics have been adapted for application in quantum information;
- Studying quantum algorithms for mathematical problems
- Enabling interaction between researchers interested in collaborating at the intersection between quantum information and mathematics.

If interested in joining, reach out to Daniel Serrano (dsvolpe@umd.edu).
Optional: 1 credit. Course number: AMSC689, Section 5201. Reach out to Jessica Sadler for help with registration (jsadler@umd.edu). To earn 1 credit, you need to give a talk and attend all sessions (2 excused absences allowed).

### Session 2 (02/12, 1pm, [Kirwan Hall 3206](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwXzPyRfxHAD5ajaA)):
__"Hidden-State Proofs of Quantumness and the Discrete Fourier Transform" - Carl Miller__

A cryptographic proof of quantumness is a hypothetical test that could be used to prove a quantum computational advantage based on hardness assumptions from cryptography.  An experimental realization of such a test would be a major milestone in the development of quantum computation.  However, error tolerance is a persistent challenge for implementing such tests: we need a test that not only can be passed by an efficient quantum prover, but one that can be passed by a prover that exhibits a certain amount of computational error.  In this talk I will present a technique for improving the error-tolerance in a cryptographic proof of quantumness. The technique is based on hiding a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state within a sequence of classical bits.  After giving an overview of this new approach, I will discuss one of the central tools used in the security proof: a strengthened uncertainty principle for the discrete Fourier transform.
