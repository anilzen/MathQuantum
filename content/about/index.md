MathQuantum is an [RTG (Research Training Group)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-training-groups-mathematical-sciences-rtg) focused on enabling Mathematicians to enter the world of Quantum Information Science. We are housed at IPST and funded by NSF. With MathQuantum, we are building an educational program (red arrow, Figure) that will blend with collaborative research (green arrow, Figure), such that education and research enhance each other in a vertically integrated training group. The research draws from a set of Mathematical areas where our faculty have expertise, and advance these by tackling QIS challenges under three themes. The training includes an innovative set of activities and prioritizes interaction between undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.

Our program is led by PI Konstantina Trivisa, and Co-PIs Maria Cameron, Andrew Childs, Daniel Serrano, and Lawrence Washington. Senior Personnel Howard Elman, Dionysios Margetis, Carl Miller, Ricardo Nochetto, Jonathan Rosenberg, Eitan Tadmor and Pratyush Tiwary, Gorjan Alagic, Thomas Haines, Alicia Koll√°r, and Deep Ray serve as research mentors. Senior Personnel Anil Zenginoglu coorindates community events, internships, and program technologies. Senior Personnel Gili Ad-Marbach leads program evluation and assessment.
