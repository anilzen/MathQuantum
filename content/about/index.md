Math Quantum is a Research Training Group housed at IPST and funded by NSF. With RTG-MathQIS, we envision delivering an educational program
(red arrow, Figure 1) that will blend with collaborative research (green arrow, Figure 1), such that education and research enhance each other in a vertically integrated training group. The training will include an innovative set of activities and prioritize interaction between undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty. The research will draw from a set of Mathematical areas where our faculty have expertise, and advance these by tackling QIS challenges under three themes.
